    <p>I grew up in the shadow of America's space program in Cocoa Beach Florida. Out of college I leveraged my mathematics degree to program with some really cool teams starting with real time work management solutions at Pam Am World Svcs on Kennedy Space Center supporting the space shuttle.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I've worked in several startup organizations GE's Tethered Aerostat in support of DEA and Corporate Facilities Management at Johnson Controls. My last two roles included working with successful startup Skillsoft in the training space and helping turn around Strategy Execution helping companies with Adaptive Leadership.</p> 
    <p>My passion is building things and understanding how they work. I like engaging and working with people but enjoy quiet time with my wife Terri, children Anya and J.R. and two dogs Molly the Border Collie and Jack the Mutt. Originally from Florida we relocated over 15 years ago and love New England.</p>
    <p>I have a very entreprenurial spirit and these days I am really excited about getting back in to programming and especially Full Stack programming so I can support my own small business but also so I can help others with have ideas that could use some programming expertise.</p>
